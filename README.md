# Hi!
### My name is Luna, dragon with an internet connection.
(You can also call me Rika, or Rya. I go by she/they.)

I like to code things.

## Who am I?
I'm [a dragon](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1072202729692340245/1083161696803233893/dragn.jpg)<sup>[1](#references)</sup>. I'm also a hobbyist programmer and musician. 

Contact me in these following ways:
- by emailing `me at rya dot gay`
- by finding me on twitter dot com, [`@lostkagamine`](https://twitter.com/lostkagamine)
- ...or my preferred method, talk to me directly on Discord! `rin#3487`

## What do I do?
I write code. If I'm lucky, it even works. I make music too, and I also play the critically-acclaimed MMORPG [FINAL FANTASY XIV](https://finalfantasyxiv.com) more than I should, so some of my work overlaps into that.

I like the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and [C#](https://dot.net) programming languages a lot.

## What have I made?
Too much to list, from [OpenGL/ImGui integration with C#](https://github.com/ry00001/OpenTK_ImGui_Backends) to [crimes against both humanity and dragonkind](https://github.com/ry00001/rustic-c). Ask me about some of my weirder projects.

I am also founder and head of [Project Asakura](https://github.com/ProjectAsakura), an open-source **online network revival service** for defunct arcade racing game "Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 6". My hosted instance boasts over 2,500 registered users!

## What do I use?
My PC setup is:
- Razer Blade 15 Base Model (early 2021)
- Intel Core i7-10750H
- 16GB of DDR4
- Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop
- 500GB SSD
- 500GB SSD
- Razer built-in display (1080p 144hz)
- Samsung LC27JG56QQUXEN (1440p 144hz)
- Oculus Rift S

Software-wise, I like using:
- Operating system: Windows 10 Enterprise (x86_64) @ `PANDAEMONIUM`
- Text editor: Visual Studio Code
- IDE: JetBrains Rider
- DAW: FL Studio 21
