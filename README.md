# Hi!
### My name is Rin. A dragon with a computer.
I like to code things, ranging from game engines to Discord bots.

## You can reach me:
- by emailing `lostkagamine at outlook dot com`
- by finding me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lostkagamine), `@lostkagamine`
- ...or my preferred method, talk to me directly on Discord! `rin#3487`

## What do you do?
I'm a freelance (read: unemployed) software developer, and hobbyist musician.
You can check my Twitter for samples of songs, or ask me directly. I'll send you some.

I'm passionate for working with C# in particular, lately. It's a great language and I'm having a lot of fun.  
Do not ask me to do Python. I will look at you menacingly.

## What have you made?
Short answer: too many things to list.  

Long answer: either ask me, or dig through my repositories. Bound to be something interesting somewhere.

## What do you use?
I'm glad you asked. My PC setup is:
- Intel Core i7-3770
- 16GB of DDR3
- Nvidia GeForce GTX 970
- 6 (yes, 6) drives (480GB SSD, 4x 500GB HDD, 1x 1TB HDD)
- Samsung LC27JG56QQUXEN (1440p 144hz)
- Samsung T22C300EW (1080p 60hz)
- Oculus Rift S

Software-wise, I like using:
- Operating system: Windows 10, 64-bit, 20H2 (don't judge me.)
- Code: a heavily customised version of Visual Studio Code (Insiders)
- IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
- DAW: Ableton Live 11 Suite/FL Studio 20
