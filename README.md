# Hi!
### My name is Sylvie. I make software.
(I go by she/they.)

I like to code things.

## An update
**As of September 4th, 2023, I am currently unhoused.** Please be patient regarding issues and support requests, and if you feel like helping me out a little bit, [you can do so here](https://paypal.me/ry00001) (or on Sponsors, but I won't get paid for that until 60 days have passed).

## Who am I?
I'm a hobbyist programmer and musician who spends too much time on the Internet. 

Contact me in these following ways:
- by emailing `hi` at `sylvie.software`, or anywhere at `nightshade.network`
- by finding me on twitter dot com, [`@lostkagamine`](https://twitter.com/lostkagamine)
- ...or my preferred method, talk to me directly on Discord! It's the same handle as Twitter, *but introduce yourself first elsewhere, otherwise I'll reject your request.*

## What do I do?
I write code. If I'm lucky, it even works. I make music too, and I also play the critically-acclaimed MMORPG [FINAL FANTASY XIV](https://finalfantasyxiv.com) more than I should, so some of my work overlaps into that.

I like the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and [C#](https://dot.net) programming languages a lot.

## What have I made?
Too much to list, from [OpenGL/ImGui integration with C#](https://github.com/ry00001/OpenTK_ImGui_Backends) to [crimes against humanity](https://github.com/ry00001/rustic-c). Ask me about some of my weirder projects.

I am also founder and head of [Project Asakura](https://github.com/ProjectAsakura), an open-source **online network revival service** for defunct 2018 arcade racing game "[Wangan Midnight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wangan_Midnight) Maximum Tune 6", created by Bandai Namco. My hosted instance boasts over 2,500 registered users!

I run [Nightshade Network](https://nightshade.network), a collection of private 'friend cloud' services for me and friends. It's powered by [Hetzner](https://hetzner.com), [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) and [NixOS](https://nixos.org).

## What do I use?
My PC setup is:
- Razer Blade 15 Base Model (early 2021)
- Intel Core i7-10750H
- 32GB of DDR4
- Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop
- 500GB SSD
- 2TB SSD
- Razer built-in display (1080p 144hz)
- Samsung LC27JG56QQUXEN (1440p 144hz)
- Oculus Rift S

Software-wise, I like using:
- Operating system: Windows 10 Enterprise (x86_64) @ `PANDAEMONIUM`
- Text editor: Visual Studio Code
- IDE: JetBrains Rider
- DAW: FL Studio 21

# Use of my software
**Unless stated otherwise, any and all public repositories on this account are unsupported. Please do not ask about how to use them, as they are personal tools, more often than not.**
You may still report issues, and I may get to them, but it is not a guarantee. I battle with burnout quite often,
and I would like to keep the threat of falling into it to a minimum.

That said, please respect the licenses. Most of my work is licensed MIT.

# About private repositories
A lot of work is under private repositories. I don't usually have any particular reason for keeping the code private,
but it's most likely because I don't think the code is finished or ready enough to be in the public eye.

Active projects will be open-sourced eventually.
