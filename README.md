(You can also call me Rika, or Rya. I go by she/they.)

I like to code things.

## You can reach me:

[I'm a real dragon. Like, seriously. Take my word for it.](https://twitter.com/lostkagamine/status/1357824812501127168)

I like the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and [C#](https://dot.net) programming languages a lot.

Too much to list, from [OpenGL/ImGui integration with C#](https://github.com/ry00001/OpenTK_ImGui_Backends) to [crimes against both humanity and dragonkind](https://github.com/ry00001/rustic-c). Ask me about some of my weirder projects.
